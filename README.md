# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Also built with json-server: no websockets or anything, so ever time you write to the db.json file (every new message/ new conversation) you must refresh to see it - somewhat annoying, but getting a live update was not my goal.

-In future will likely refactor, implementing some custom hooks to get practice. Also could more logically organize files and css.
